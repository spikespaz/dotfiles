# Jacob's NixOS Dotfiles

Welcome. This repository houses my personal configuration files for my computers running NixOS.

If you are interested in my configurations for certain programs, check out the `users` directory.

## Troubleshooting

If there are any issues with programs, search the codebase for the name of the program and look for comments. I add notes whenever I see something funny that needs to be tweaked.

## References

It would have been an impossibility to set everything up without the support of several people. I thank them for both their conversational guidance and graciously sharing their personal configurations for me to read and learn from.
